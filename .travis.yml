# although this is a node.js project, specify the use of Java in order for OTP
# and datatools-server to run as expected on Java 8 specifically. Although not
# confirmed in any way, another thought with using a Java-specific image is that
# some things may be more optimized for Java thus making for more expedient and
# reliable execution of Java code.
