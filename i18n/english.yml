      for which there is no transit service running may appear in this list."
      FEED_TRAVEL_TIMES_ROUNDED: "This is a common feature of GTFS feeds that do
      not use down-to-the-second precision for arrival/departure times. However,
      if this precision is expected, there may be an issue occurring during feed
      export."
      MISSING_TABLE: "Missing a required table is a major issue that must be
      resolved before most GTFS consumers can make use of the data for trip
      planning or in other applications."
